My professional portfolio.
Stack: Linux, Caddy and Python (Flask)

March 23, 2024: First iteration of the portfolio. It still needs some formatting work, but it's more than a minimum viable, so it's time to get it online.

Update:
I've taken this portfolio off of self-hosting. I successfully ran it there for a couple of months, but the host I was on found ways to charge me that I did not want to pay, so I'm now on Python Anywhere.

July 3, 2024: I have gone through many iterations of this portfolio and it's finally looking like the website that I want. The latest changes are a new blog that uses SQLite and slug pages, and a reformat of the skills section, and refining the mobile resoponsiveness. I have some blog articles to write now that I've gotten the LLC up and running, so that will be next.
